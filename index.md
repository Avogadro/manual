## Avogadro 2

In particular, this manual covers the new release of Avogadro 2, a major update, and includes major changes, the revised interface, and new features. Most sections include notes on changes from v1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to the new 2.0 release.

For new features, a "New in 2.0" heading is included.
