The input generator allows you to \(1\) pick the type of coordinates: real-space Cartesians or reduced coordinates and \(2\) pick the type of geometry optimization \(if any\).

Another important option is setting the occupation scheme \(1\) and SCF options \(2\) and \(3\).

Finally, when finished, you can click the “Compute” button \(not pictured\) if Abinit is available locally on your computer, or “Generate” to save the input file for submission to a remote queue.
