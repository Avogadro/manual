# Drawing Molecules

## Creating a Molecule

Molecules can be built and edited with the draw tool.

You can begin creating a molecule by left clicking on the black display. This will generate a carbon atom. Right clicking on the atom will delete it.

Left clicking and dragging the mouse will generate a bond to another carbon atom.

Different elements can be selected from the Element drop down menu. Typing the atomic symbol (e.g., "A-s" for Arsenic) is a shortcut for changing the selected element.

For example, if you wanted to create water, you can type in "O", or select "Oxygen (8)" from the drop down menu and click on the black display.

If the "Adjust Hydrogens" box is checked, hydrogens in the molecule are automatically adjusted to satisfy valency (as shown above).

Bond order can be changed through the Bond Order drop down menu, or by typing the numbers "1", "2", or "3". Bonds can also be added to a molecule by left clicking on a bond that has already been created (this process cycles through single, double, and triple bonds). Right clicking on a bond will delete the bond, and the atom it's bonded to.

For example, to create carbon dioxide, the general structure ("O-C-O") needs to be drawn, and then by left clicking the bonds in the molecule, double bonds will be created.

Under the "Extensions" menu, the geometry of a molecule can be optimized by selecting "Optimize Geometry".
