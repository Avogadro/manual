# The Bond-Centric Manipulate Tool

The Bond-Centric Manipulate tool alters angles, bonds, and torsions of a molecule.

Left clicking on a bond and dragging your cursor allows you to adjust the plane. If the "Show Angles" box is checked, the angles from the selected bond to all adjacent bonds are displayed.

As you're rotating the plane you'll notice that if the "Snap-to Bonds" box is checked, the plane will change colors between yellow and blue. If the plane depicted is yellow then the plane *is* in line with an adjacent bond. If the plane depicted is blue the plane *is not *in line with any adjacent bonds.

The "Snap-to Threshold" determines how far away a plane has to be to *snap* to an adjacent bond plane. For example, below the Snap-to Threshold is 10 degrees. If the plane being rotated comes within 10 degrees of an adjacent bond, that plane will snap to the adjacent bond plane. If the Snap-to Threshold is changed to 90 degrees, the rotating plane will only snap to adjacent bond planes.

Once a plane is selected the atoms on either end of the plane can be manipulated, by left clicking on the atom and dragging. The displayed angles will automatically adjust, and the selected bond will *not* change in length.

Left clicking on a substituent, or in this case a hydrogen bonded to one of the selected carbon atoms will allow you to adjust the torsion angle.
