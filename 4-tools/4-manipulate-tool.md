If inserting a fragment, the manipulate tool is automatically selected so that the fragment can easily be rotated into position. 

The "Translate by:" section allows you to easily translate the length of a bond (to a fragment or atom) into the desired positon. For a translation to take place, enter in the desired translation and then click "Apply".

The "Rotate around:" section allows you to rotate your selection around the geometry, or the origin. This section then gives you the ability to choose how many degrees to rotate the fragment. Click "Apply" once you've made your selection.

Clicking "Reset" will reset all of the information in the translation, and rotation boxes. This does not reset the molecule, if you want to undo your adjustments go to the "Edit" menu in the top bar and select "Undo Manipulate Atom".
