# Naming a Molecule

Avogadro includes support for naming compounds using a network request to the PubChem database, which includes over 112 million compounds. Since these are deposited by chemical suppliers, pharmaceutical companies, etc. the database may not cover _**every**_ molecule you may build, but includes a broad selection of compounds.

![Analysis => Properties => Molecularâ€¦](../.gitbook/assets/Naming.png)

Open up the Molecule Properties window, under the View menu.

![Note the molecule name for ethane](../.gitbook/assets/Ethane.png)

The IUPAC name will initially show as (pending) while the server returns the name, (unknown) if the molecule is not found in the resolver, or (unavailable) if your network connection is down or the resolver service is otherwise unreachable.

![The molecule name will update as you make changes](../.gitbook/assets/Substituted.png)

As you modify the molecule (e.g., adding Br atoms), the name will update automatically with the other properties, albeit while temporarily showing (pending)
