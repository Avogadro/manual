The IUPAC name will initially show as (pending) while the server returns the name, (unknown) if the molecule is not found in the resolver, or (unavailable) if your network connection is down or the resolver service is otherwise unreachable.

As you modify the molecule (e.g., adding a Cl atom), the name will update automatically with the other properties.
