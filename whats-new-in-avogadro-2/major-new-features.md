# Major New Features

### Layers

A major new feature in Avogadro 2 is the layer system. You can create new layers for a wide variety of tasks:

* hide part of the molecule \(e.g., put solvent fragments into one layer and hide it during analysis or editing\)
* change rendering options \(e.g., display a protein with cartoon, but show a few key residues with ball-and-stick rendering\)
* lock a layer to prevent editing \(e.g., moving a molecule to bind with a locked surface or protein active site\)

A new section on the Layer doc and tutorials on using layers for common tasks is available

### Symmetry Properties

Avogadro 2 includes a new tool to perceive molecular symmetry, display symmetry elements, and explore subgroups and classes of symmetric atoms.

### Python Commands / Plugins

With Avogadro 2, it's easier than ever to create a quick Python script and add it as an Avogadro command. These scripts can modify the molecule / atoms \(e.g., add a solvent box\), run analysis \(e.g., assign R and S stereochemical labels with `rdkit`\), optimize the geometry, create nanoparticles or nanotubes using installed Python modules \(e.g., `pymatgen` or `ASE`\), and many more.

You can also share your plugins through GitHub and others can download and instal or update to new versions through the "Download Extensions" command.
